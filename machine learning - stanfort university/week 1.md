### introduction
#### what is machine learning?
1. supervised learning
* regression problem
* classification problem
2. unsupervised learning

### model representation and cost function
1. model representation
2. cost function
* intuition

### parameter learning
1. gradient descent
* intuition
* gradient descent for linear regression

### linear algebra review
1. matrices and vectors
* matrix: no. of rows * no. of columns
* matrix elements: Aij
* vector: an n * 1 matrix (n dimensional vector)
* vector element: yi
2. addition and scalar multplication
* matrix addition
* scalar(number) multiplication
3. matrix vector multiplication
* A (m * n) * A (n * 1) = A (m * 1)
* prediction_vector = data_matrix * parameter_vector
